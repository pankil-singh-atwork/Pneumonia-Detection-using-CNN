# DETECTION OF PNEUMONIA FROM CHEST X-RAYS

## Abstract

Pneumonia is a serious infectious disease that affects the lungs and can be life-threatening if 
left untreated. Early detection of pneumonia is crucial for effective treatment and
management. Chest X-rays are a common diagnostic tool used to detect pneumonia in 
patients.
In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been developed to assist radiologists in 
detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. These algorithms use deep learning techniques to 
analyze X-ray images and identify patterns associated with pneumonia.
The detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays using machine learning has shown promising 
results in terms of accuracy and speed. With further development and refinement, these 
algorithms could become a valuable tool in the early detection and treatment of pneumonia, 
potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## Problem Description 
- The dataset which is taken can be imbalanced which can cause errors in accuracy
hence it might give wrong results.
- The chosen model may not be having many neural networks which can affect the
visualization and prediction of the disease as the images doesnâ€™t pass through the
convolutional hidden layers
- The pediatric patients suffer because of inaccurate X-Rays causing effect on their
growing health
- The ongoing models work on frontal X-Ray whereas Lateral X-Ray can give more
accuracy on the position of the disease

## Research Objectives 
- Goal: use lung X-rays to identify pneumonia
- Accurate diagnosis is important for treatment
- Self-built CNN presented to classify lung X-ray images
- Neural network trained using provided dataset
- Focus on improving disease visualization for precision and accuracy
- CNN categorizes patient X-rays for presence of pneumonia
- CNNs are promising technology for processing medical images
- They may help make diagnosis more straightforward and accurate.
